# PNG test images 202105

Created to test [AVIF](https://netflixtechblog.com/avif-for-next-generation-image-coding-b1d75675fe4) & maybe [JpegXL](https://cloudinary.com/blog/tag/JPEG-XL) formats in browsers.

All images are 400x400; large enough to visualize quality, but fast to process.  Files shrank with using [FileOptimizer](https://nikkhokkho.sourceforge.io/static.php?page=FileOptimizer).

[files.txt](files.txt) is a plain file listing to help with scripts.

File prefixes are flags for content-types, as described below:
