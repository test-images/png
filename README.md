# PNG
Test images for PNG format, typically used to convert to other formats.

Latest files are in [202105](./202105/202105.md)

## License

MIT, though art, photos, website screenshots are (c) of their respective creators.  I tried to use "Free for commertial use" for 3rd party content, & website screenshots are in 'fair use' due to the nature of this testing (small snipit in context).
I may have used only a portion of 3rd party files, so do not expect clones.
